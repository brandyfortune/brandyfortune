						<h1>Information Architecture and User Experience Design</h1>

						<p>Brandy Fortune began creating websites in 1998 developing experience prototypes for Autotrader.com while attending college at the Art Institute of Atlanta.</p>

						<p>By 2002 Brandy was creating XHTML and CSS2 for Cingular.com, one of the first commercial companies to embrace the updated standard. She created many wireframes, design comps and html prototypes for the &quot;Human Centered Design&quot; group within AT&amp;T Mobility.</p>

						<p>In 2006 Brandy was granted a promotion and moved to the Sales organization focusing on Information Architecture and to proliferate the IA &amp; Usability Methodologies she had found to be successful over the years and by creating mobile usability kits for testing POS applications in the field. In 2007 Brandy had the privilege of speaking at WebDU on the topic of "Usability for Designers and Developers".</p>

						<p>Technical "how-to" presentation, user will leave session knowing how to conduct their own usability tests and will have example protocol testing documents to build their own tests on, as well as a list of which equipment to buy and an overview of how it all works together.

						<ul>
							<li>Part 1: How I came to be involved in usability testing.</li>
							<li>Part 2: Participatory Design and User Testing - What value does it have? Why should you do it?</li>
							<li>Part 3: Participatory Design Sessions - Creating Mood Boards based on user feedback and brainstorming, picking a design direction. (Real world example screens from Cingular.com resulting from Mood Board exercises)</li>
							<li>Part 4: Iterative User Centered Design Sessions - Showing multiple designs to users. (Real world example design comps from internal Customer Sales Portal)</li>
							<li>Part 5: Usability Tests on functional areas - Live and Protocol Based sessions. (This will include protocol examples, transcripts, data extraction, as well as how to present findings and recommendations)</li>
							<li>Part 6: How to facilitate, How to setup equipment. (Detailed list provided for equipment purchases)</li>

						<blockquote>&quot;The Adobe crew were interesting, but frankly they were all glossed in a little 'sales' gleam. When it was people like Brandy Fortune (power to you Brandy), Kai KÃ¶nig, Jesse Warden, Charlie Arehart, Caleb Adam Haye and Dmitry Baranovskiy, these are the people using the technology they are the real stars, the real people with real stories, no sales, no pitch, no NDAs. WebDU needs to enlist more of these types of speakers.&quot; - See more at: http://manwithnoblog.com/

						<blockquote>&quot;I worked with Brandy when AT&amp; T Mobility (formerly Cingular Wireless) was forming, a lot of new changes were coming about, and we were involved in large collaborative projects refreshing the external and internal company web sites, she being the sole designer at times working with an external consulting firm. She entered into these design and usability projects with fresh and intelligent enthusiasm and patience, and sought to always use the latest coding standards at the time (CSS2 for example). She delivered countless visual designs, wire frames, and web sites, always of high quality and on time or ahead of schedule; some of these web sites were in use for almost ten years. She has a passion for learning, exhibits great creativity and is fun to work with!&quot; - Kristi Eide [Senior Marketing Product Mgr AT&amp; T Mobility]</blockquote>
